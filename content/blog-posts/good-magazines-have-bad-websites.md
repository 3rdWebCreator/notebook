## Have you tried visiting the website of a major magazine lately? 

It’s a disaster. There are pop-ups and ads loading everywhere. 

But turn on reader mode in your browser and suddenly the content shines again. Reading the articles is so much more enjoyable without all the junk cluttering everything up. That’s the way readings should be. And that’s pretty much how the notebook site looks. I finished up my subtle CSS alterations. I made a small adjustment. And I simply removed a font I didn’t like, and added a little highlighting to the links. The low highlight CSS track was inspired by a WordPress theme called patch. I found a small description for how to achieve the effect on this site. Next I plan to get this thing hosted on Fleek.
