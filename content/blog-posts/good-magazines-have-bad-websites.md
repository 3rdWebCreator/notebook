Have you tried visiting the website of a major magazine lately? Itâ€™s a disaster. There are pop-ups and ads loading everywhere.

But turn on reader mode in your browser and suddenly the content shines again. Reading the articles is so much more enjoyable without all the junk cluttering everything up. 

That was my goal for _Notebook._ After some subtle CSS alterations it pretty much looks like reader mode in Firefox. 

One little embellishment I did allow was a low highlight on the links. The CSS truck was inspired by a WordPress theme called Patch. I found a small description for how to achieve the effect here. 

Next I plan to get this thing hosted on Fleek.
