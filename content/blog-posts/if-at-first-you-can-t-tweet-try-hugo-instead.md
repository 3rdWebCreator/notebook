I tried, and failed to tweet last night. For no apparent reason, Twitter wouldn’t let my account post anything.

Ironically, getting blocked by a social network is the perfect beginning for the new project I was trying to tweet about.

 I am working on an experimental digital magazine called _Creator._ It will document the transition to Web 3 for content creators that want their own publishing platform. The magazine will be a case study on how to publish (or mint) work that an audience can own, archive, collect and even resell for a profit.

Think of _Creator_ as a new take on Kevin Kelly’s concept of “One Thousand True Fans“ with tools from the blockchain era. At least, that’s the idea I was trying to tweet about. 

Naturally I decided to abandon Twitter for a Web 3 microblog built with Hugo, and hosted on IPFS.

This is that microblog, which I am simply calling _Notebook._ Inspired by the writings of Seth Godin and Austin Klein, I want to “put myself on the hook,” and “show my work.” The posts will be raw, but close to real time. And while my words may be harder to find here on the 3rd web, they’ll never be blocked by Twitter. If that sort of thing interests you, I hope you will come back to follow along.
