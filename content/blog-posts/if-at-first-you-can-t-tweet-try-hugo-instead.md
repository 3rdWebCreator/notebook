I tried, and failed to tweet last night. For some reason, which is still unclear to me, Twitter wouldn’t let my account post anything.

Ironically, getting blocked by a social network is the perfect beginning for the new project I was trying to tweet about.

 I am working on an experimental digital “magazine“ called _Creator._ It will document the transition to Web 3 for content creators that want their own publishing platform. It’s for those that want an audience to be able to own, archive, collect and even resell their work.

 I want to re-examine Kevin Kelly’s concept of “One Thousand True Fans“ with tools from the blockchain era. At least, that’s the idea I was trying to tweet about. It’s only fitting then that I abandon Twitter for a Web 3 microblog built with Hugo, and hosted on IPFS.
