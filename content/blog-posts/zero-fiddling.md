There’s a reason why this site looks so bare bones. I don’t want to spend a lot of time on the design. I’m trying to make a magazine, not a blog. I know that documenting the work in a blog will be valuable, but I am also mindful that every minute spent on _Notebook_ (the blog) is a minute not spent on _Creator_ (the magazine). I even chose a minimalist theme from [Forestry.io](https://www.forestry.io) just so I wouldn’t be tempted to fiddle with the design.

But if I have to look at the site almost daily, I want to like it. Today I am permitting myself to do a little fiddling with CSS. Soon though, I’ll set it, and forget it.

The goal is quick, frictionless updates, and zero fiddling.
